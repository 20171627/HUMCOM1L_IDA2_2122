            <article>
                <p>
                GTFO is a survival horror first-person shooter cooperative game developed by
                Swedish indie studio 10 Chambers. GTFO had its initial release on December 9, 2019, for Microsoft Windows,
                on Steam's Early Access to a positive user reception. The game was officially released 2 years later, on December 
                10, 2021, during The Game Awards 2021. Your team of prisoners is dropped into the Rundown when a new Work Order is 
                issued by the Warden, the mysterious entity holding you captive. The Rundown is a series of expeditions, each one 
                taking you deeper into a decayed research facility called the Complex. You descend level by level, scavenging tools 
                and resources that help you survive in a perilous network of tunnels where gruesome creatures lurk in every shadow. 
                Complete all of the expeditions to fulfill the Work Order and clear the Rundown.

                <p>
                The Chicxulub Crater was formed 66 million years ago by an asteroid strike that 
                resulted in a mass extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs. A team of "prisoners" are forced to go down into 
                an underground complex built on the asteroid site to scavenge and carry out tasks for a mysterious entity known 
                as The Warden. GTFO players form a team of four scavengers who are forced to explore the vast 
                underground complex in order to complete the Warden's objectives. Complicating the process is the presence of 
                hideous sleeping monsters, who have overrun the whole area. The players must strategize, plan, ration resources 
                and stealthily kill enemies to survive, and work to fulfill the Warden's demands and be allowed to escape.
