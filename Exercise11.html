        <h3>Top 3 of my most favourite Starbucks Coffee Drinks </h3>

          <h4 id="M1">Caramel Macchiato (P145/short, P155/tall, P170/grande, P185/venti)</h4>
            Is anyone really surprised that this classic Starbucks drink is one of the most-ordered drinks locally? This espresso-based drink is perfect for those who like their coffee fix sweet, with freshly steamed milk blended with vanilla syrup, and topped with caramel drizzle in the signature crisscross pattern. The Caramel Macchiato debuted in Starbucks in 1996, just a year before the coffee chain opened its first Philippine store. While it was first launched as a special limited-edition beverage to mark Starbucks 25th anniversary, the drink soon became an instant hit, and a mainstay on the menu.

          <h4 id="M2">White Chocolate Mocha (P145/short, P155/tall, P170/grande, P185/venti)</h4>
          
            It's easy to see why the White Chocolate Mocha is a dependable drink, especially for first-timers.  It's no secret that chocolate goes well with coffee, with the latter's dark notes boosting the sweetness of the former—common knowledge that resulted in the mocha, a drink that blends espresso, chocolate, and milk. Starbucks' white-chocolate version has espresso, steamed milk, whipped cream, and white chocolate syrup.

          <h4 id="M3">Caffè Americano (P110/short, P120/tall, P145/grande, P160/venti)</h4>
          
            Sometimes all you need is a straightforward cuppa to get you through the rest of the day, and the Caffè Americano fits the bill. From the name, you can already tell that Americans had something to do with the invention of this now-classic. It's popularly believed that the Americano was born from Americans based in Italy who would pour hot water over their espresso to dilute it. At Starbucks, they top an espresso shot (or shots, depending on your request) with hot water to form a layer of crema on top. The Caffe Americano is a good drink to order if you want to try Starbucks different kinds of single-origin beans at their Reserve branches.
