            <h1>There are four roles that Riot Games has allotted for all the agents in the game. Here is a quick breakdown of how each class plays out. Do note that some agents can easily fit into more than one category because of their versatile utility.

                (Duelist)
                The “DPS” class is capable of getting quick frags in rounds. All duelists can hold their own in fights with their offensive abilities. Jett is by far the most popular duelist in the game, with the best professional duelists taking advantage of her kit.
                
                (Initiator)
                Initiators have abilities designed to initiate fights and give teams an advantage when a teamfight breaks out. They can break open sites or zone opponents for a tactical advantage. Sova is one of the best Initiators to pick up if you want to try out the Initiator class.
                
                (Sentinel)
                Sentinels are all about holding zones and reinforcing territories. Sage is a great sentinel to pick up as she is a classic support character capable of reviving teammates, and she can also set up walls to block off zones.
                
                (Controller) If you want to take charge of the battlefield and dictate fights, the controller class might be the one for you. Controllers can help teams execute strategies by blocking off areas with smokes and disrupting the enemy team. They can be a menace to deal with if you do not strategize against them.
