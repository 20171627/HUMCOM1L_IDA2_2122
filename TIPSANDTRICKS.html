            <h1>There are different maps in the game, and more agents and maps are added all the time, which keeps the gameplay loop fresh in Valorant. Regardless of which map or agent you are using, the core objectives remain the same. Here are a few tips and tricks to help you win more games if you are new:

                (Planting/Defusing Spikes)
                Playing the objective is what you should focus on. While taking out the enemy team also wins you the round, one bad, rushed teamfight can completely ruin your odds of winning a round. Even if you are aggressively going for kills, you should focus on the objective.
                
                (Angles)
                Take advantage of the high ground and sneaky angles to take enemies by surprise. The TTK (time-to-kill) is very low in Valorant, so getting a jump on enemies can offer a massive advantage in fights.
                
                (Adaptability:) You should be ready to adapt to the enemy team and your team composition at all times. The same playstyle might not work in every match, making it essential for players to focus on each situation differently.
                
                (Coordination)
                It is essential to coordinate with your teammates to assure your chances of success. Valorant is a team shooter, and if you are unable to communicate and help your team, you will not find success in the game.
                
                (Combine Your Abilities)
                Some agents can work together and create cool combos. You can also combine abilities with your weapons. Take advantage of your smokes and disruption abilities to give yourself an edge.
                
                (Steady Your Aim)
                Running and gunning has been a menace in the game for the longest time, but it received nerfs recently. If you shoot while sprinting, you will have a more challenging time aiming at enemies.
                
                (Listen to audio queues)
                This will take a lot of practice but try to learn the sounds. You will be able to figure out when enemies use teleporters or when a specific agent uses an ability. Learning audio queues takes time, but being alert in-game will help you a lot in the long-run.
                
                (Always plan your next move:) Each time an enemy goes down or your teammate goes down, reassess your plans and communicate your next approach. You need to be methodical and have a plan if you want to win in Valorant.
                
                Now that you know the basics of playing Valorant, you should download the game and give it a shot right away. It is one of the most popular competitive games out there right now, and it is approachable for players of any experience level.</h1>
