                (Agent Selection)
                Each time a match kicks off, you get to choose an agent. All players must pick unique agents, and it is recommended to get a good mix of classes to ensure victory. While you can win with 5 Duelists, it isn’t exactly optimal.
                
                (Buy Phase)
                Once you load into a random map, you will either start as the attacking team or the defending team. Before the start of each round, you have to buy abilities or weapons. Your performance dictates how much currency you get, so you might not get the best loadout every single round.
                
                In the first round, you start with one ability and a sidearm. You have to earn credits to buy better guns and abilities. Do help out your team if they are low on credits and buy them guns if they need them (if you have the budget). Kills, plans, and wins give you the most credits.
                
                (Round Start)
                If you are an attacker, your goal is to put down the defenders or plant/detonate the spike. If you are a defender, you need to take out the attackers or stall them long enough. If they plant the spike, you can defuse the planted spike to win the round as well. You have only 100 seconds to execute your plan, so communication is key.</h1>
